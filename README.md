# [I am learning how to become a web developer on the Online DevSchool!](https://onlinedevschool.com)

Learning a combination of Ruby and JavaScript via multiple live 1 on 1 sessions every week with my mentor, expert Rubyist and Polygot programmer, Jim OKelly, and also attending several weekly group sessions where we discuss and disseminate real world programming code, I am learning what it takes to not just be a web developer in today's technology market. I am learning what it means to become a GREAT WEB DEVELOPER!

At the online DevSchool they don't believe in making me build pinterest/twitter/facebook clones that are useless to me and everyone else. Instead I get to participate in the building of real software, used by real companies, and not just any old companies, but awesome non-profit/NGO's like New Story Charity (http://newstorycharity.org), who crowdfund homeless families into efficient homes of their own!

Anyone can follow an A-Z list to build a piece of software, but that really doesn't teach very much. In real software no one knows up front what the A-Z is anyway. Being a good web developer or programmer is about learning how to find not just "A Answer" but an elegant answer that I understand and that fits nicely into the application I am building.
